A comprehensive web-based platform for exploring and implementing advanced cryptographic techniques, steganography methods, and multilayered security systems. Built with modern web technologies and designed for both educational and practical security applications.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In today's digital landscape, traditional single-layer encryption methods are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Organizations and individuals need robust, multilayered security solutions that combine multiple protection mechanisms. Our platform addresses this critical need by providing:

- **Educational Gap**: Limited accessible tools for learning advanced cryptographic concepts
- **Security Vulnerability**: Over-reliance on single encryption methods
- **Implementation Complexity**: Difficulty in combining multiple security layers effectively
- **Practical Application**: Need for real-world security tools with modern interfaces

## 🛡️ Threat Model

### Attack Vectors Addressed

| Threat Level | Attack Type | Our Defense | Implementation |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Basic** | Plaintext Interception | AES-256 Encryption | Web Crypto API |
| **Intermediate** | Key Compromise | RSA-2048 Key Exchange | Asymmetric Cryptography |
| **Advanced** | Traffic Analysis | Steganographic Hiding | LSB Pixel Manipulation |
| **Expert** | Multi-vector Attack | Multilayered Security | Guardian Layer System |

### Security Assumptions

## Security Implementation Details
### AES-256-GCM Encryption
```
// PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
const key = await crypto.subtle.deriveKey(
  { name: "PBKDF2", salt, iterations: 100000, hash: "SHA-256" },
  baseKey,
  { name: "AES-GCM", length: 256 },
  false,
  ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
);
```
### RSA-2048 Key Generation
```
// Generate RSA key pair with OAEP padding
const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
  { name: "RSA-OAEP", modulusLength: 2048, publicExponent: new Uint8Array([1, 0, 1]), hash: "SHA-256" },
  true,
  ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
);
```
### LSB Steganography Algorithm
```
// Hide data in least significant bits of image pixels
const hideData = (imageData: ImageData, data: string) => {
  const binary = data.split('').map(char => 
    char.charCodeAt(0).toString(2).padStart(8, '0')
  ).join('');
  
  for (let i = 0; i < binary.length; i++) {
    const pixelIndex = i * 4; // RGBA format
    imageData.data[pixelIndex] = (imageData.data[pixelIndex] & 0xFE) | parseInt(binary[i]);
  }
};
```
